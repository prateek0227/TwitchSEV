# TwitchSEV

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

The following questions have been answered in this demo project :-

1. The first/home page lets a user login with Twitch and set their favorite Twitch streamer name. This initiates a backend event listener which listens to all events for given streamer.

*For this question, I was able to complete the first part of the question but the second part was a little confusing and the most suitable answer that I found was that of using webhooks (the user follows event) but it is not returning any response when I tried to follow a user.*

2. The second/streamer page shows an embedded livestream, chat and list of 10 most recent events for your favorite streamer. This page doesnâ€™t poll the backend and rather leverages web sockets and relevant Twitch API.

*Embedding the twitch app for the selected streamer has been done successfully. By the list of 10 most recent events, what I understood was to list the Future and Past events of the current streamer. I was able to find one streamer who had some Events so I intentionally queried for that user just to show the list of the events.*

Additionally please answer following questions at the bottom of your README:

1. How would you deploy the above on AWS? (ideally a rough architecture diagram will help)
2. Where do you see bottlenecks in your proposed architecture and how would you approach scaling this app starting from 100 reqs/day to 900MM reqs/day over 6 months?

*I don't have enough knowledge about AWS, so, I won't be able to answer these questions. But, using elixir and phoenix, we won't find much of a bottleneck as regards to the number of users requesting the server on a single day as elixir is built on the erlang ecosystem and the erlang vm has been built specifically to handle more the 2 million concurrent requests on a single server. So if we can provide enough memory to the EVM on AWS, we won't face server load.

Another option would be to deploy this elixir/phoenix application using Gigalixir which provides a full distributed clustering support to run elixir applications and by this the thought of bottleneck is gone as I have already told how many concurrent requests the elixir ecosystem can handle.*
